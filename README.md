<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Did you know, based on data from the Ministry of National Education (MONE) suggested that the prevalence of children with autism in Indonesia is growing by 15% every year.A large percentage of Indonesians still have little understanding about autism (and other disabilities) due to limited access to media and other health information. This is particularly likely to apply to those who live in small cities and rural areas. 

Based on this problem, we are curious about how to quickly detect autistic children and provide Indonesian citizens with more literacy about autism. So we thought of a solution to create an android application that can help, namely EADI. EADI is short for Early Autism Detection Invention which is an android application that can help parents detect their children who have not detected autism. We will also provide articles that can educate the public. Besides being able to speed up the detection of autism, this application also has the potential to help parents to provide better care for their children. This is the reason why we want to solve this problem.
